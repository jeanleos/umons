# RGB to YUV conversion

In this project, we attempt to create an IP core that inputs two number and returns their sum.

Vitis and Vivado 2024.2 were used for this project.

We provide the files to synthetise, implement and deploy the project in the Pynq-Z2 FPGA. Subsequently, we have:
- Untitle.cpp: The C++ description that should be imported in Vitis, synthetised and packaged.

- design_1.bit and design_1.hwh: Bitstream and Hardware Handoff files which have been implemented for the Pynq-Z2 FPGA.

- /vitis: Vitis project folder
- /vivado: Vivado design folder
- simple_sum.ipynb: the notebook to transfer in the FPGA board.
