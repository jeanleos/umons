# FPGA toy examples

In here, we create two toy examples to familiarise with the FPGA toolchain (Vitis and Vivado).

We provide two examples:
- matrix_coefficients_add: A project that inputs a 3 by 3 matrix and ouputs the sum of its coefficients.
- rgb_yuv_conversion: A project that inputs a RGB image and outputs an image in the YUV format. Conversely, the YUV to RGB conversion is made on the CPU to compare the implementation's result.

## Requirements

The above examples have been tested with Vitis and Vivado `2024.2`.
