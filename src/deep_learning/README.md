# Deep learning examples

In this section we provide a few examples of deep learning in a Jupyter Notebook.

## Examples

- Divisibility by 3: In this deep learning model, we provide the model with an input floating-point number and the model indicates whether the floored number is divisible by 3. For instance, 3.846 gives 3 when floor is applied, and is divisible by 3.
- 2 by 2 matrix determinant: In this model, we provide a model with four coefficients that represent a 2 by 2 matrix. The model tries to predict an approximation of the determinant.
