# Exploration of optimisations

In this part, we explore further possible optimisations. Namely, we decided to explore [Lavin and Gray](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.1509.09308)'s adaptation of [Winograd](https://doi.org/10.1137/1.9781611970364)'s convolution.

Another part of the code has been copied from [wincnn](https://github.com/andravin/wincnn) which allows to calculate the A, B, and G matrices.

We also let the reader explore Fast Fourier Transform.
